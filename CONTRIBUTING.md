## Features to Implement/Settle
These are some features and ideas that make up the vision of where sit could eventually go. Feel free to add to this list or begin working on one of these features!
- [ ] pretty printing
- [ ] unsafe mode (or not, just more customizable and overwriteable defaults)
  - [ ] pipe (|) or similar operator for custom chaining of any git commands. Could call this unsafe mode
    - [ ] make sit wrap almost all git commands for this mode, customizability 
  - [ ] configuration file or settings for user to configure own defaults
  - [ ] user-defined combinations? maybe under configuration settings as well?
- [ ] More sit command combos !!
- [ ] More tests
- [ ] Logging
